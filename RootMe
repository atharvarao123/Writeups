Rated Easy on tryhackme 
Pretty straight forward 
The questions will help you with the enumeration process
Use gobuster only to find the hidden directory (I tried with dirb  & dirbuster and it didnt find the hidden file)
Getting the initial shell might be confusing for people who are new to pentesting(Hint : rename )
Priv esc might be trial and error if you cannot find the file which is not supposed to be there

my rating : easy
the box was pretty fun to do
